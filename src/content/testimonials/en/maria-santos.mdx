# Maria Santos - First-Time Home Buyer in Riverview

Working with Ciara was a game-changer for our family. As immigrants navigating the US home buying process, we had so many questions and concerns - especially around work visas, documentation requirements, and understanding the financial side.

## Why We Chose Ciara

We found Ciara through a friend's recommendation in our church community. What immediately stood out was her bilingual capability and genuine understanding of the immigrant experience. She didn't just translate documents - she explained the "why" behind every step in both English and Spanish.

## The Process

Ciara connected us with a lender who specialized in working with visa holders. She helped us understand:

- What documentation we needed (and didn't need)
- How our income would be verified
- What neighborhoods fit our budget and lifestyle
- School districts that would be best for our children

## The Result

We found our dream home in Riverview - a 4-bedroom home with a yard for our kids and close to excellent schools. The neighborhood has a strong Hispanic community, which was important to us. We've been in our home for two weeks now and couldn't be happier.

## Our Advice

If you're an immigrant family considering buying in Tampa Bay, don't hesitate to reach out to Ciara. Her cultural understanding, bilingual support, and real estate expertise made all the difference for us.
