# Tampa Bay Real Estate Market Update - January 2026

The Tampa Bay real estate market continues to show strong fundamentals as we enter 2026. Here's what buyers and sellers need to know right now.

## Key Market Indicators

- **Median Home Price**: $425,000 (up 3.2% YoY)
- **Average Days on Market**: 28 days
- **Inventory**: 2.1 months supply (balanced market)
- **Mortgage Rates**: Averaging 6.25% for 30-year fixed

## Buyer Insights

For buyers, the market has stabilized compared to the volatility of previous years. Interest rates have come down from their 2024 peaks, making affordability more accessible. Multiple-offer situations are still common for well-priced homes in desirable neighborhoods like South Tampa, Hyde Park, and Riverview.

## Seller Insights

Sellers are seeing strong demand, especially for move-in ready homes priced appropriately. Homes that are overpriced or need significant repairs are sitting longer on the market. Professional staging and photography continue to make a measurable difference in time-to-sale.

## Looking Ahead

We expect continued stability through Q1 2026, with seasonal pickup in activity as we approach spring. The Tampa Bay area remains attractive to out-of-state buyers seeking lifestyle, weather, and economic opportunity.
